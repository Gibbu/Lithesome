description: 'An Unstyled component library for Svelte 5.'
order: 1

Why make this and not use [MeltUI](https://melt-ui.com) or [BitsUI](https://bits-ui.com)?  
I wanted to make this for 3 reasons:

1. I don't enjoy the builder pattern that Melt uses, though it does give you ultimate control. Bits is using Melt under the hood, which in turn uses Svelte 4 and stores.
2. I wanted to try out all the new features of Svelte 5.
3. I wanted to make a component library that I will use for all my other projects which will have the API that I find useful, and hopefully others do too.
