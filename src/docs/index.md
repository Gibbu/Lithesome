Why make this and not use [MeltUI](https://melt-ui.com) or [BitsUI](https://bits-ui.com)?  
I wanted to make this for 3 reasons:

1. I don't enjoy the builder pattern that Melt uses, though it does give you ultimate control. And Bits is using Melt under the hood, which in turn uses Svelte 4 and stores.
2. I wanted to try out all the new features of Svelte 5.
3. This originally was something I was buiilding for another project I'm working on, but decided I liked it a lot that others might too. I will also be using this in all my new projects.

## Credits

- [Melt UI](https://melt-ui.com) - The accessability requirements and how they function.
- [Bits UI](https://bits-ui.com) - Some of the API/prop control flow.
- [Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com/) - The accessability requirements and how they function.
- [Svelte Headless UI](https://svelte-headlessui.goss.io/docs/2.0) - The class function prop and action forwarding prop.

## Why the name Lithesome?

"Lithesome" is another term for "Lithe", which intern means "thin", "supple", and "graceful".
